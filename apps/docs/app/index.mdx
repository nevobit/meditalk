# Overview

Welcome to the repo platform documentation. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about our architecture, development practices, and platform components.

## What is repo?

repo is a modern, scalable platform built with a microservices architecture that provides:

- **Multi-platform applications**: Web portal, mobile app, and marketing site
- **Robust APIs**: GraphQL and REST APIs for flexible data access
- **Design System**: Consistent UI components across all platforms
- **Enterprise-grade infrastructure**: Kubernetes, AWS, and comprehensive monitoring

## Platform Architecture

Our platform follows a **monorepo structure** with clear separation of concerns:

```
repo/
├── apps/                 # Applications
│   ├── portal/          # Main web application
│   ├── mobile/          # React Native mobile app
│   ├── site/            # Marketing website
│   ├── graphql/         # GraphQL API server
│   └── rest/            # REST API server
├── packages/            # Shared packages
│   ├── design-system/   # UI component library
│   ├── sdk/            # Client SDK
│   ├── business-logic/  # Core business rules
│   └── ...             # Other shared packages
└── infrastructure/      # Infrastructure as Code
```

## Key Technologies

### Frontend

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Next.js 14** for web applications
- **React Native** for mobile
- **Design System** for consistent UI

### Backend

- **Node.js** with TypeScript
- **GraphQL** (Apollo Server)
- **REST APIs** (Fastify/Express)
- **PostgreSQL** for data persistence
- **Redis** for caching

### Infrastructure

- **Kubernetes** for orchestration
- **AWS** for cloud services
- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code
- **Docker** for containerization
