# Foundations

Foundations define the rules that guarantee consistency across all apps in the monorepo:

- **Color**: semantic palette and usage.
- **Typography**: hierarchy, fluid sizes, readability.
- **Spacing**: scale and densities.
- **Grid & Layout**: 12-column grid and container queries.
- **Radius & Shape**: corners and surfaces.
- **Elevation**: layers and shadows.
- **Breakpoints**: responsive strategy (prefer container queries).
- **Iconography**: style, sizes, stroke.
- **Interaction**: focus, states, minimal motion.
- **RTL**: bidirectional support using logical properties.

See **Tokens** to centralize values and **Theming** for brand/dark modes.
